Sinatra Start
=================

Start your Sinatra project easily like singin' a song. This is a Sinatra based skeleton to start your project easily.

#  What's included
I tried to work only with official components adn doing less things as I could be locally with the project.

## Structure
Since the Sass port has a separate repo and serves a slightly different audience, the contents of the project differ greatly from the main Bootstrap project. This ensures the Sass port is as compatible with as many Sass-based systems as possible.
